# Day 3 Task

## **Task 1: Class Creation (Dog Class)**

### What I Learned:
In this task, I learned how to create a class in Python and define methods inside it. I also understood how to initialize attributes and call methods using class instances.


### Difficulties Faced:
I had to make sure that I called the methods correctly using the object instance.

### Final Thoughts:
Creating classes and objects helps to structure the code in an organized way, allowing for better reuse and management.

## **Task 2: Constructor Usage**

### What I Learned:
I explored how to use constructors to initialize object attributes when creating a class instance. This ensures that each object has unique values assigned at creation time.


### Difficulties Faced:
Understanding the constructor syntax was tricky at first, but practicing helped clarify its usage.

### Final Thoughts:
The constructor is a powerful tool for initializing object attributes and making the class instances dynamic.

## **Task 3: Inheritance (Puppy Class)**

### What I Learned:
This task taught me how inheritance works in OOP. I learned how a subclass (Puppy) can inherit attributes and methods from a parent class (Dog) and also add its own methods.


### Difficulties Faced:
Understanding inheritance concepts took time, but once I saw how methods were shared between parent and child classes, it became clearer.

### Final Thoughts:
Inheritance allows subclasses to share functionality from parent classes, making the code more reusable and organized.

---

## **Task 4: Multiple Inheritance (Hybrid Class)**

### What I Learned:
I learned about multiple inheritance, where a class (Hybrid) can inherit from more than one parent class (Dog and Cat). This allows a class to possess behaviors from both parent classes.


### Difficulties Faced:
I had some confusion regarding how methods from both classes would interact, but the example clarified the concept of multiple inheritance.

### Final Thoughts:
Multiple inheritance can be powerful, but it should be used carefully to avoid conflicts and ensure clarity in the class structure.

---

## **Task 5: Encapsulation (Robot Class)**

### What I Learned:
I gained an understanding of encapsulation, where class attributes are hidden or protected to avoid direct access from outside the class. This helps maintain data integrity.



### Difficulties Faced:
At first, I struggled with the concept of private and protected attributes, but it became clearer as I worked through examples.

### Final Thoughts:
Encapsulation is essential for protecting the internal state of an object, ensuring that data is accessed and modified in controlled ways.
