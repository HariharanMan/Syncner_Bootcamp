## **Task 2: AI, ML, DL Relationship Diagram**

### What I Learned:
AI, ML, and DL are interconnected but distinct concepts. AI is the broad field that encompasses ML and DL. ML is a subset of AI, and DL is a subset of ML. 

### Explanation:
AI is the overarching field focused on creating machines that can simulate human intelligence. ML is a subset of AI focused on algorithms that allow machines to learn from data. DL is a further subset of ML that deals with deep neural networks and complex models.

### Difficulties Faced:
Creating a clear visual diagram that accurately represents the relationships was a bit tricky.

### Final Thoughts:
Understanding these relationships helps clarify the scope and connections between the fields, which is crucial for applying them effectively.

## **Task 3: Data Scientist Roles Research**

### What I Learned:
I researched various data science roles and identified key positions in the field. Each role has distinct responsibilities, but all revolve around extracting insights from data.

### Roles:
1. **Data Analyst**: Analyzes data to provide actionable insights, creates reports, and assists in decision-making.
2. **Machine Learning Engineer**: Designs and builds machine learning models, optimizes algorithms, and ensures scalability.
3. **Data Scientist**: Combines domain knowledge and programming skills to develop models that predict future trends and behaviors.

### Difficulties Faced:
It was difficult to find specific, up-to-date information on job descriptions that clearly differentiated between the various roles.

### Final Thoughts:
Understanding the different roles within data science helps in choosing the right career path based on your interests and skills.

## **Task 4: Data Science Lifecycle Example**

### What I Learned:
I learned how the data science lifecycle works by applying it to a real-world problem. Understanding each step of the lifecycle is crucial to implementing effective data science projects.

### Application: **Healthcare Prediction Model**

1. **Problem Definition**: Define the goal of predicting patient outcomes.
2. **Data Collection**: Collect medical records, lab results, and patient history.
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Train a predictive model and evaluate it using metrics like accuracy and precision.
5. **Deployment & Monitoring**: Deploy the model in a healthcare system and continuously monitor its performance.

### Difficulties Faced:
I had trouble breaking down the lifecycle into actionable steps that would be easy to apply in a real-world project.

### Final Thoughts:
The lifecycle is a step-by-step process that ensures the proper development and deployment of data science models.

## **Task 5: Data Science Ethics Discussion**

### What I Learned:
Ethics in data science is a crucial area of focus, especially concerning issues like bias and privacy.

### Ethical Issue: **Bias in Algorithms**
Bias in algorithms occurs when data used to train models reflects prejudice, leading to unfair outcomes. This can impact hiring, law enforcement, and loan approvals, among other areas.

### Difficulties Faced:
Identifying a specific ethical issue and explaining its broader impact in simple terms was challenging.

### Final Thoughts:
Ethical issues in data science must be addressed to ensure fairness, transparency, and trust in AI systems.
