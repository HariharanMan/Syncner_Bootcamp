# Day 4 Task

## **Task 1: Basic Linear Regression**

### What I Learned:
In this task, I learned how to implement a simple linear regression model using Python’s `sklearn` library. This task helped me understand how to fit a model with one predictor variable and one outcome variable.

### Difficulties Faced:
Splitting the data and making sure the model was properly trained and tested were the initial challenges, but working through the steps clarified the process.

### Final Thoughts:
Basic linear regression is a good starting point for understanding machine learning models, and R-squared is a helpful metric for evaluating model performance.

## **Task 2: Data Visualization for Regression**

### What I Learned:
I learned how to visualize the relationship between the predictor and the outcome variable. Plotting the data points and fitting a regression line helped me better understand the linear model.


### Difficulties Faced:
Understanding how to overlay the regression line onto the data points was a bit tricky, but after reviewing the code, it became clear.

### Final Thoughts:
Visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the model’s fit and how the predictor affects the outcome.

## **Task 3: Multiple Linear Regression**

### What I Learned:
In this task, I expanded on basic linear regression by implementing multiple linear regression, which involves using more than one predictor variable.


### Difficulties Faced:
Handling datasets with multiple features and making sure all data was properly preprocessed took some time. However, once the data was cleaned, fitting the model was straightforward.

### Final Thoughts:
Multiple linear regression allows for more complex models by considering multiple predictors, which can lead to better predictions.

## **Task 4: Model Assessment**

### What I Learned:
This task focused on assessing the performance of the regression model using two key metrics: R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

### Difficulties Faced:
Understanding the significance of both R-squared and RMSE in model assessment was initially challenging, but after applying them, I understood their role in evaluating the model’s accuracy.

### Final Thoughts:
Model assessment is crucial for understanding how well a model generalizes to unseen data. R-squared and RMSE provide useful insights into model accuracy.

## **Task 5: Feature Impact Analysis**

### What I Learned:
I learned how to analyze the impact of each feature on the predictions made by the model, using either coefficients or feature importance methods.

### Difficulties Faced:
Understanding how to interpret the coefficients and feature importance scores initially seemed complex, but it became clear once I reviewed the model's output.

### Final Thoughts:
Feature impact analysis helps determine which features are most important for making predictions, and understanding this can help improve the model’s performance.
